# Predicting Algae Blooms

This case study will introduce you to some basic tasks of data mining: data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, and predictive model construction. For this initial case study we have selected a small problem by data mining standards. Namely, we are addressing the problem of predicting the frequency occurrence of several harmful algae in water samples. 

# Problem Description and Objectives

High concentrations of certain harmful algae in rivers constitute a serious
ecological problem with a strong impact not only on river lifeforms, but also
on water quality. Being able to monitor and perform an early forecast of algae
blooms is essential to improving the quality of rivers.

With the goal of addressing this prediction problem, several water samples
were collected in different European rivers at different times during a period
of approximately 1 year. For each water sample, diâ†µerent chemical properties
were measured as well as the frequency of occurrence of seven harmful algae.
Some other characteristics of the water collection process were also stored,
such as the season of the year, the river size, and the river speed.

One of the main motivations behind this application lies in the fact that
chemical monitoring is cheap and easily automated, while the biological analysis
of the samples to identify the algae that are present in the water involves
microscopic examination, requires trained manpower, and is therefore both
expensive and slow. As such, obtaining models that are able to accurately
predict the algae frequencies based on chemical properties would facilitate
the creation of cheap and automated systems for monitoring harmful algae
blooms.

Another objective of this study is to provide a better understanding of the
factors influencing the algae frequencies. Namely, we want to understand how
these frequencies are related to certain chemical attributes of water samples 
as well as other characteristics of the samples (like season of the year, type of
river, etc.).

R programming, machine learning models such as multiple regression, random forest,  and regression trees were built.
